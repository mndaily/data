Welcome to the Minnesota Daily's data repository for admin salaries. Here are some notes regarding our data:

* Some universities build their budget around calendar or academic year, or operate on a fiscal year that differs from the University of Minnesota's, which runs from July 1 to June 30.
* The University of Iowa, Northwestern University, University of Michigan and University of Maryland have been excluded from the administrative data.
* Pennsylvania State University is only required to make some of its salary data available; consequently only five of the school's administrators are included in the data.
* Some administrative positions at the University of Minnesota that existed in Fiscal Year 2013 had not been created in 2006, while some had differing names or duties within their titles.
* Some universities pay professors for nine months of work, others pay them for twelve months.
* University of Minnesota Vice President for Health Sciences and Medical School Dean Aaron Friedman's base annual salary was $121,500 in FY '13 for his work as a faculty member. As an interim vice president, he also received an additional $308,812 stipend.
* The Minnesota Daily has made both mean and median annual base salary data available for administrators to disclose the influence any outliers may have had on the data.
* The AAUP has prohibited the Minnesota Daily from making the professorial salaries available in any form other than an infographic. As a result, this data has been excluded from the repository.
